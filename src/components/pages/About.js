        <p>There’s never enough TIME in the day when you need it. That’s particularly true when you have a child with autism. In fact, sometimes it may feel as if you’re stretched to breaking point.

            What can you do, though? Your child has an autism spectrum condition. They can be choosy, get overwhelmed, don’t enjoy all the same things that other kids do… and perhaps can be a little difficult, too. You can handle it all, but could a stranger? And would they do it with the same love and care that you do?

            The answer is YES.

            At TIME we understand that your child is too precious to leave with just anyone. We recruit and train a team of bright, hard-working, dedicated support workers whose passion is helping young people and adults with autism. We look for people who have that special touch and the ability to cope with anything that’s thrown at them (quite literally, in some cases!).

            When you get in touch, you’ll receive a home visit to find out about your child’s needs – and yours. Whether you’re looking for a regular break, someone on the occasional weekend, or help during the holidays, we choose a support worker to match.

            DBS checked, fully trained and full of ideas on what to do and where to go… they’re ready to give you that all important TIME so that you can feel refreshed.

            So what are you waiting for?</p>
